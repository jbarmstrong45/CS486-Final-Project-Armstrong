<h1>Implementation Decisions</h1>

The bowling ball was modeled with a primitive sphere, and was given coordinate velocities to roll towards the pins. The pins were modeled with primitive cylinders, and remain motionless until the bowling ball intersects with the front pin. Once that happens the pins fly backward and rotate until hitting the back wall and falling downward.
It was decided that the back wall of the modeled bowling alley and the three bowling lanes were the most sensible candidates for texture mapping.
